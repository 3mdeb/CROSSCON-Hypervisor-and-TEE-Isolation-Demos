# CROSSCON TEE Isolation

Here you can find the initial version of the _CROSSCON TEE Isolation_: ... developed as part of the [CROSSCON project](https://crosscon.eu/). The repository contains on overview of the CROSSCON .... 

## Overview

**CROSSCON TEE Isolation** is developed as part of the [CROSSCON project](https://crosscon.eu/). It leverages the [CROSSCON Hypervisor](https://github.com/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor).

A more detailed description of CROSSCON SoC, BA51-H and Perimeter guard can be found in deliverable 4.1 of the [CROSSCON project](https://crosscon.eu/).


### Prerequisite
We assume that you are following the instructions on a PC with a working setup of Ubuntu or Debian OS.
Before you jump to Demos you need to install each Tool in the following list:

#### How to experiment CROSSCON Hypervisor Dynamic-VM feature?
To configure multiple Dynamic-VM features, this experiment will show you how to prepare a configuration file that follows a scenario containing a Linux OS alongside a Bare-metal application in a single CPU.




#### How to experiment CROSSCON Hypervisor Per-VM TEE feature?
This experiment involves features of previous demos, combining the dynamic-VM feature together with trusted OS execution in normal world. This experiment will use OP-TEE as trusted OS and will be carry out in the APU platform qemu.
